Healthcare 3.0 is a decentralized web application that can be used to save medical records and medication history of a patient on Ethereum and EVM based layer-1 and layer-2 protocols.

Medical records and medicine history of a patient recorded in a centralized infrastructure can be easily tampered with . Patient on a medication receives hardcopy of medication advised on every checkup which leads to lose of records and medication history . Moreover , a patient receives new medicines every week without going over left-over medicines he/she might already have at home which leads to wastage of medicines. It shows the poor medical recording systems and inventory control system in healthcare with centralized infrastructure.

Our project aims at shifting healthcare records and medication details on blockchain with the help of ethereum protocol and evm-based layer-1 and layer-2 protocols such as polygon matic and shardeum.
Healthcare 3.0 aims at providing the following features:
- Assigning medication to patients from doctors using blockchain transactions.
- Patients will be provided unique "patientId" instead of traditional username and password for logging in.
- Patients can add doctor's wallet address in their profile for giving them rights to check medical history or assign medications
- Doctors not added to patient's profile can't access the profile even with "patientId"
- Authenticated doctors can assign medication to patients using their "patientId"
- For inventory controlling , dosage and duration of medication is tracked using solidity's "block.timestamp" (timestamp of a block in a chain)
-System also provide patient with option to store allegries so that wrong medicine is not assigned to him
-Sytem also checks for assigned of Banned drugs

Future Scope:
Application can be used as a blueprint for building a layer 2 evm-based protocol for healthcare .
